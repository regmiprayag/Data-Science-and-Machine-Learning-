    "The Concept of Machine Learning can be applied to any organization/domain to in order to cut costs, mitigate risks, and improve overall quality of life including recommending products/services, detecting cybersecurity breaches, and enabling self-driving cars. With greater access to data and computation power, machine learning is becoming more ubiquitous every day and will soon be integrated into many facets of human life.  \n",

    "In the earlier days, to help user with the decision from machine, the systems used hardcoded rules of **if** and **else** construct. To take an example of sentiment analysis, to classify the text as **positive** or **negative**, list of positive and negative words can be constructed and then the rules can be applied. However, this is not the feasible solution. So, moving from **Bag of words**, **n-grams**, **skip-grams**, **word2vec**, **doc2vec** and the **transformers** model, now the sentiment analysis has been a common task due to the advancements in machine learning and vector representation.\n",
